#### Python 3 based Snips template
This is a working action template for Snips written in **Python 3**.

It is based on the Python 2-based action code from [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-app-template-py/blob/master/README.md), which was rewritten in **Python 3**. The file **setup.py*** was adapted to first remove existing Python 2 virtual environments before activating the Python 3 virtual environment.
