## Python 3 based Snips template
This is a working action template for Snips written in **Python 3**. It is based on the Python 2-based action code from [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-app-template-py/blob/master/README.md), which was rewritten in **Python 3**.

Detailed explanations of the code can be found on the link given above.
